# Blockchain Basics

## Cyfrin Updraft 2025

### What is blockchain?

- The first protocol to use this amazing technology was created by pseudo-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto when he presented Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008.
- Blockchain is a peer-to-peer transaction system without intermediaries
- Blockchain is powered by cryptography and decentrality and allowed people to engage in censorship resistant finance in a decentralized way.
- People took to it like a Superior Digital Store of Value (SDSV), that is; like gold.
- Ethereum was introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and got accepted as a protocol where developers used the native token as both value and asset while you can only have Bitcoin as values on ther Bitcoin network.

- **Oracle:** Like Chainlink, oracle does the off-chain computation for blockchain e.g prices, currencies, gold, weather, forex etc.

- **Layer 2s:** Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain solves scalability issues in the Ethereum ecosystem. There are two different types of L2: Optimistic Rollups and Zero Knowledge Rollups.
- Optimistic: Arbitrum and Optimism
- Zero-knowledge: ZKsync/ZKEvm

- **DApp:** A Decentralized Application (DApp) means a combination of many smart contracts.

#### Importance of Web3/Blockchain

- Unbrakable Promises: Blockchain gave the rise to unbreakable promises. Doing the right thing becomes infrastructural.

### Summary

- Bitcoin is the first protocol to take this technology (blockchain) to limelight.
- And Bitcoin also took Cryptocurrency into the mainstream.
- Bitcoin was a sort of digital gold or a store of value, able to make transactions between users in a decentralized manner.
- Ethereum took this technology a bit further by allowing users to create smart contracts
- Smart contract can also be taught to be a kind of decentralized trust minimized agreement.
- Smart contracts and Decentralized Apps can access and interact with the real world using something called `Oracle` Decentralized Oracle Networks (DON).
- Hybrid Smart Contracts are contracts that combines both on-chain logic and off-chain decentralized data and decentralized computation.
- This gives rises to both on-chain and off-chain logics being decentralized, giving us all the features that traditional agreement have.
- The digital currencies like the Bitcoin and Ethereum have value, even without the smart contract part.
- Smart contract value = Trust Minimized Agreement (Unbreakable promises).

## Other Blockchain Benefits

1. **Decentralized**

- Smart contracts are decentralized without any intermediaries.
- Different individuals that own this blockchain are called `node operators`.
- And it is the combination of these thousand of `node operators`, running this algorithm, smart contract and the same software that makes the network decentralized.

2. **Transparency & Flexibility**

- In the decentralized network, since all these individual `node operators` runs the software (at the same time), everybody can see what's happening on-chain.
- Every operator has perfect information and has to play by the same rules, meaning that there's no privacy.
- And besides, blockchain is pseudo-anomnymous which means one is not necessarily tied to an identity in the real world.

3. **Speed & Efficiency**

- Bank transfers especially offshore takes longer, while transactions on the blockchain networks happens instantly.

4. **Security & Immutability**

- Once a smart contract is deployed (mainnet), it can't be changed, altered or tamper with in any way.
- This makes the security more easy than in a centralized world where someone can hack into the server and alter the information.
- Even if your computer or backup computer goes down. All of your data is safe, because it's being run on the other decentralized nodes.
- Even if the nodes goes down, so far one of them has a copy of the information, it can always be redistributed.
- Hacking a blockchain is nearly impossible.
- All you need to access your information, assets and other valuables is your `Private Key` which serves as your password in the decentralized world.

5. **Counterparty Risk Removal**

- Financial and other institutions don't have our interest at heart and so therefore, the blockchain technology removes intermediaries.

6. **Trust Minimized Agreement**

- This can also be referred to as programatic unbreakable promise.
- Blockchain moved users away from brand based agreements to math based agreements.

### Setting Up Wallet

- Users can have multiple accounts in a single wallet.
- Each account has different `Private keys`.
- BUT the wallet has only one set of a 12-series words called `Secret Phrase` (Mnemonic Phrase).

### Intro To Gas

- Gas refers to the computational effort required to execute a transaction on the blockchain.
- Whenever a transaction is initiated, the `gas` serves as the payment made to ensure that the transaction is successful.
- Blockchain are run by a group of different nodes, the nodes are handled by humans.
- The nodes operators are referred to as `Miners` (Bitcoin) or `Validators` (Ethereum), depending on the network.
- These `Miners` gets incentivized for running the blockchain by earning a fraction of the native blockchain currency for processing transactions.
- The higher the transaction's complexity, the more `gas` it requires.
- The total transaction can be calculated by multiplying the `gas used` with the `gas price` in Ether (not Gwei).
- That is; `Transaction Fee` = `gasPrice` x `gasUsed`.
- The more people are sending transactions at the same time, the more expensive the `Gas Cost` are going to be.
- `Gas Price` in Ethereum transactions sets the cost per unit of gas specified for the transaction.

### How Do Blockchain Work?

- A `hash` is a unique fixed length string meant to identify a piece of data.
- `Hash Algorithm` is a function that computes data into a unique `hash`.
- `Mining` is the process of finding _solution_ to the blockchain _problem_.
- Nodes gets paid for mining blocks.
- A `block` in the blockchain is a list of transactions `mined` together.
